## Project Description
This project explores lexical decision data to investigate how word-level features influence reaction time during word recognition. The dataset (*Haro et al., 2024*) includes average reaction times, error rates, and a rich set of psycholinguistic variables (e.g., frequency, word length, age of acquisition, familiarity, concreteness). By analyzing these variables, we aim to replicate well-established findings in psycholinguistics and highlight how word characteristics shape lexical access.

## Research Aim
The primary goal is to examine the relationship between reaction time and word features, specifically focusing on:
1. Word length (orthographic complexity)  
2. Familiarity (subjective frequency of exposure)  
3. Frequency and age of acquisition (classic predictors of lexical decision performance)

## Hypothesis
- **H1 (Word Length Effect):** Longer words will elicit slower reaction times in the lexical decision task.  
- **H2 (Familiarity Effect):** More familiar words will elicit faster reaction times.  
- **H3 (Frequency Effect):** Higher frequency words will be recognized more quickly than lower frequency words.  
- **H4 (Age of Acquisition Effect):** Words acquired earlier in life will show faster reaction times compared to later-acquired words.

## How to Reproduce

The analyses can be reproduced using **Excel** with the Data Analysis Toolpak enabled.

### 1. Descriptive Statistics
- Go to **Data ‚Üí Data Analysis ‚Üí Descriptive Statistics**.  
- Select variables such as `mean_rt`, `length`, `fam`, `log_frq`, and `aoa`.  
- Output mean, SD, min, max for each variable.  

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Method A (formula):  
  - In an empty cell, type:  
    `=CORREL(B2:B1000, C2:C1000)`  
    (replace with the actual column ranges for `mean_rt` and another variable).  
- Method B (tool):  
  - Go to **Data ‚Üí Data Analysis ‚Üí Correlation**.  
  - Select the range covering `mean_rt`, `length`, `fam`, `log_frq`, `aoa`.  
  - Output the correlation matrix to view r values.  

### 3. Scatter Plots with Trendlines
- Select two columns (e.g., `length` and `mean_rt`).  
- Go to **Insert ‚Üí Chart ‚Üí Scatter Plot**.  
- Right-click data points ‚Üí **Add Trendline ‚Üí Linear**.  
- Check options: **Display Equation** and **Display R¬≤ on chart**.  
- Repeat for:  
  - `fam` vs. `mean_rt` (H2)  
  - `log_frq` vs. `mean_rt` (H3)  
  - `aoa` vs. `mean_rt` (H4)  

### 4. Regression (Optional)
- Go to **Data ‚Üí Data Analysis ‚Üí Regression**.  
- Dependent variable (Y): `mean_rt`.  
- Independent variables (X): `length`, `fam`, `log_frq`, `aoa`.  
- Output regression summary (coefficients, p-values, R¬≤).  

### 5. Interpret Results
- **H1:** RT √ó Length ‚Üí Positive correlation (longer words = slower RT).  
- **H2:** RT √ó Familiarity ‚Üí Negative correlation (familiar words = faster RT).  
- **H3:** RT √ó Frequency ‚Üí Negative correlation (higher frequency = faster RT).  
- **H4:** RT √ó AoA ‚Üí Positive correlation (later-acquired words = slower RT).  

## Results (Preliminary Findings)

### Correlation Analyses
- **Reaction Time √ó Word Length (H1):**  
  r = 0.27 ‚Üí Positive correlation. Longer words are associated with slower reaction times, supporting the Word Length Effect.  

- **Reaction Time √ó Familiarity (H2):**  
  r = -0.55 ‚Üí Negative correlation. More familiar words are recognized faster, supporting the Familiarity Effect.  

- **Reaction Time √ó Frequency (H3):**  
  Expected: Negative correlation (higher frequency ‚Üí faster RT).  
  Analysis: In this dataset, words with higher log frequency show faster reaction times, consistent with the Frequency Effect.  

- **Reaction Time √ó Age of Acquisition (H4):**  
  Expected: Positive correlation (later-acquired words ‚Üí slower RT).  
  Analysis: Words acquired earlier in life tend to be recognized faster, supporting the Age of Acquisition Effect.  

### Summary
- **Word length** increases processing demands ‚Üí slower recognition.  
- **Familiarity** improves lexical accessibility ‚Üí faster recognition.  
- **Frequency** facilitates lexical access, confirming a robust frequency effect.  
- **Age of Acquisition** strongly predicts RT: earlier-acquired words are processed faster.  

These results replicate classic psycholinguistic effects observed in lexical decision tasks.
